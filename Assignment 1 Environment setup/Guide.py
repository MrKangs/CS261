To do all of the learning parts, you need to setup download Python that the versionis higher than 3.7.

Also, you need to download numpy for package usages. 

You can download Python in this site: https://www.python.org/

Once you donwload python, then search for cmd and enter this: pip install numpy

If the cmd gives you to enter something else, please do that first then reenter the following statement above. 

For text editor: I use VSCODE from Microsoft. You can download from this site: https://code.visualstudio.com/

Once you install VSCODE, I would recommend to download Code Runner and Python Extensions that can provide a lot of support. 

Once you did all of the following, then System_test.py if you install correctly. If there is an issue, then google it!

Ignore the hello_gradescope.py and output.txt
