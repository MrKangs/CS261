Big O notation is a tool for characterizing a function 
in terms of its growth rate. 
Specifically, big O notation is used to indicate an 
upper bound on that function’s growth rate. 
This upper bound is known as the growth order of the function 
(hence the “O” in “big O”) and is itself typically 
specified as a mathematical function.

# We use big-O notation in the analysis of algorithms to describe an algorithm’s usage of computational resources, 
# in a way that is independent of computer architecture orclock rate.
# The order of fastest to slowest follow by the following below (note: Before to test, run timethis.py first!)
# O(1)
# O(log(n))
# O((n)^(1/2))
# O(n)
# O(n * log(n))
# O(n^2)
# O(n^3)
# O(2^n)
# O(n!)

# This time to run the code is important when we talk about bigger data values: 
# it will take ages if we run the code with a lot data
# Therefore, we need make sure we are using the shortest notation as possible to reduce the time
# to complie the program. That is the main object from this lecture
